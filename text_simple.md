## Introduction

Recent advancements in computational life sciences have shown promising results in various research areas [@mejia-hernandezSmartphoneApplicationsEvaluation2018]. This is consistent with other studies [@mejia-hernandezSmartphoneApplicationsEvaluation2018].

## Mathematical Equation

The equation for a linear regression model is given by:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

Where:

- $y$ is the dependent variable
- $\beta_0$ is the intercept
- $\beta_1$ is the slope
- $x$ is the independent variable
- $\epsilon$ is the error term
